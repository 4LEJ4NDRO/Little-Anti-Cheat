# Little Anti-Cheat - Development Notes:

### Todo:

1. NoLerp\
Oddly enough, two server owners are having issues with NoLerp detections detecting legit players.\
Sadly, I have not been able to reproduce any false positives at all, and these server owners haven't really responded to my questions regarding their server settings.\
I suspect the problem lies with the interp settings the server allows... But not sure.\
It is something I will look more into.

2. Auto Update\
People have asked me to add support for auto update. I think I'll look into adding this for version 1.6.0.

3. Anti-Wallhack\
Some people have asked me to add Anti-Wallhack support.\
So fine, I'll make an **ALPHA** Anti-Wallhack plugin soon.

4. CS:GO detections\
Seems like my biggest users are Russian server owners who mainly host servers for CS:GO, and they want me to add more detection methods for CS:GO specific cheats.\
Sadly, I don't play CS:GO, but alright, I'll look into CS:GO cheats soon and add some stuff.
