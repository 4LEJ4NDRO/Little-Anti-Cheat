# Little Anti-Cheat - Development Notes:

### Notes:

1. NoLerp\
Oddly enough, two server owners are having issues with NoLerp detections detecting legit players.\
Sadly, I have not been able to reproduce any false positives at all, and these server owners haven't really responded to my questions regarding their server settings.\
I suspect the problem lies with the interp settings the server allows... But not sure.\
It is something I will look more into.

2. Auto Update\
You MUST install this plugin for Auto-Update to work: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1570806

3. Anti-Wallhack\
Some people have asked me to add Anti-Wallhack support.\
So fine, I'll make an **ALPHA** Anti-Wallhack plugin soon.

4. Infinite Noisemaker-Spam Detection\
This is a new cheat detection for TF2 only, and it is in beta.\
So for now, it will ONLY log players it suspects of using infinite noisemaker spam.\
If no one reports false positives with steps on how to reproduce, then it will get changed to permanent bans in the future.
